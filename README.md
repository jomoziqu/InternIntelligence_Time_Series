# InternIntelligence_Time_Series

# Time Series Forecasting Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops and compares time series forecasting models (SARIMA and Prophet) to predict future trends using historical data. The AirPassengers dataset (monthly airline passengers from 1949 to 1960) is used as an example, but the code can be adapted to any time series data (e.g., sales, stock prices).

**Key Tasks**:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trend, seasonality, and stationarity.
- Model development with SARIMA and Prophet.
- Performance evaluation using MAE and RMSE.
- Visualization of forecasts and model comparison.
- Ensemble modeling by combining SARIMA and Prophet predictions.

## 🛠️ Features
- **EDA**: Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Model Training**: Implement SARIMA (with auto-tuning) and Prophet.
- **Evaluation**: Compare MAE and RMSE metrics.
- **Visualization**: Forecast vs. actual plots, ACF/PACF analysis.
